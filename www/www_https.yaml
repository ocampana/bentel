# This file is the build-time configuration of static resources and
# custom response handlers to be used in the application with TLS
# support.
#
# See: https://gitlab.com/slimhazard/picow_http/-/wikis/Build-time-configuration
#
# This file is identical to the YAML file for the application without
# TLS (see www.yaml in the current directory), except:
#
# - brotli encoding is specified for the compressible static resources.
# - this file includes the "certificate" object, to configure the
#   server certificate and private key.
#
# For the TLS version we use brotli compression, since the common
# browsers include "br" in the Accept-Encoding request header if the
# request is sent via TLS. brotli compression usually results in
# smaller files than gzip compression -- this is true of all of the
# static files in the sample app. The advantages are a smaller
# footprint for embedding the static objects in flash, and smaller
# HTTP responses to send over the network.
#
# The "certificate" configuration is required for an HTTP server that
# supports TLS.
#
# Otherwise the present configuration is identical to www.yaml in the
# current directory. See the comments in www.yaml for details about
# the configuration of static resources and custom response handlers.

# The "static" elements for compressible resources specify "br" in the
# "encodings" field, as discussed above.

# The "certificate" element has two fields "crt" and "key", both
# required. Both of them specify files on paths relative to the "www"
# directory. The two files MUST be in DER (binary) format. See:
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding
#
# "crt" is the path of the server certificate, and "key" is the
# server's private key.

      crt: crt/picow-sample.crt
      key: crt/picow-sample.key
